# WizQuiz Design and Implementation Choices

1.Themed Design: The decision to create a themed quiz around the magical world of Harry Potter was made to add an element of familiarity and enjoyment for users who are fans of the book series. Themed quizzes tend to engage users more effectively, providing a cohesive and immersive experience. The choice of colors, fonts, and the creative title ("WizQuiz") contributes to a visually appealing design.

2.Tkinter and Ttkbootstrap:Tkinter was chosen for the graphical user interface due to its simplicity and widespread use. Ttkbootstrap was employed for styling to enhance the overall aesthetics. Tkinter provides a straightforward way to create GUI applications in Python. Ttkbootstrap extends Tkinter's capabilities by offering modern styles, making the application visually appealing with minimal effort.

3.QuizApp Class: The implementation of the QuizApp class was chosen to encapsulate the entire quiz logic, providing a modular and organized structure. Using a class promotes code reusability and separation of concerns. Each method within the class handles specific functionalities such as displaying questions, checking answers, and managing the timer.

4.Randomized Questions: The decision to randomize the order of questions in each quiz session was made to increase replayability and prevent users from memorizing the sequence.
Randomizing questions adds an element of unpredictability, making each quiz session unique and challenging.

5.Timer Functionality:Implementing a timer for each question was chosen to introduce a time constraint, adding excitement and encouraging quick thinking.Timed quizzes are more engaging and simulate a real-time challenge. Users must answer questions promptly, enhancing the overall quiz experience.

6.Feedback System:Providing instant feedback on user answers was implemented to offer a dynamic and informative experience. Feedback informs users about the correctness of their answers and, in the case of incorrect responses, educates them by displaying the correct answer. This enhances the learning aspect of the quiz.

7.Customizable Quiz Data:The design choice to allow easy customization of quiz data was made to enable developers to adapt the quiz to various themes or subjects. A customizable quiz enhances the project's versatility. Developers can easily replace the provided quiz data with their own, extending the application's usability.

# Challenge:
Balancing timer duration with question complexity was a challenge. Too short a time might be too difficult, while too long might reduce the challenge.
Resolution: The timer duration was set at 15 seconds, providing a balance between challenge and user experience. This can be easily adjusted based on user feedback or preferences.
